Slide #22 - Relation Practice Questions

1) WorksOn
2) 9
3) 4
4) Domain of resp is a string.  Domain of hours is a number (integer).


Slide #23 - Database Definition Question

Answer: D
True statements:
1) A database is data.
2) A database system is software.
4) Usually, more than one user can use a database system at a time.
5) The cardinality is the number of rows in a relation.


Slide #24 - Database Definition Matching Question

Answer: C) table, row, column


Slide #25 - Cardinality and Degree Question

Answer: B (cardinality is the number of rows)


Slide #28 - Keys and Superkeys Question

Answer: A) true 
A key is a minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies a row in a table.  A superkey uniquely identifies a row but does not have to be minimal.  Thus, a key is always a superkey but not vice versa.


Slide #29 - Keys and Superkeys Question (2)

Answer:  A) true
A good example is that students in the class could be identified by student id  and (first name, last name).  These are both keys, but the first one has one attribute and the second has two.


Slide #30 - Keys and Superkeys Question (3)

Answer:  B) false  Keys are part of the schema not the data.


Slide #31 - Example Relational Data Questions

1) Probably not.  According to what we are modeling we are not told that ename is a key and cannot assume that it is just because there are no two people with duplicate names in the current relation instance.

2) No because there are two tuples with value the same value E7 for eno.  Also, we know from the project description that an employee can work on multiple projects, which means that for each project they work on there would be a tuple in the WorksOn relation.  Hence, duplicate values of eno is possible.

3) Superkeys = {(eno,pno), (eno,pno,resp), (eno,pno,dur), (eno,pno,resp,dur) }


Slide #35 - Integrity Constraints Question

Answer: C


Slide #36 - Entity Integrity Constraints Question

Answer: A  (only one field has to be null, not all of them)


Slide #37 - Referential Integrity Constraints Question

Answer: B  Foreign key field can be null.  They just cannot contain a value that is not in the primary key.
  

Slide #38 - Integrity Questions

Answer: B) 9
Emp violations:
- tuple 1 - salary = "AS" (domain)
- tuple 6 - eno = null (entity integrity)
Proj violations:
- none
WorksOn violations:
- tuple 1 - pno = "P0" (ri)
- tuple 3 - eno = null (ei)
- tuple 5 - eno = "E9" (ri)
 tuple 7 - pno = null (ei)
 tuple 8 – E6 (ri)
tuple 9 – P6 (ri)
 tuple 11 - eno = null, pno = null (ei)
