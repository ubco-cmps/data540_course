Introduction to Labs
=======================

We are using GitHub Classroom to provision the labs. 
You will first need to accept the invitation to join our GitHub Classroom.
Once the lab is ready for you to accept, click the below to accept the lab:

| Lab                                   | Due Date                 | Link to Accept                                        |

Once you click the link, a repository will automatically be created for you with some starter code.
You can now work on the lab, make commits, and push them to GitHub as you please. 
Once the deadline and the grace period has passed, you will no longer be able to push any changes.
